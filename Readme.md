switch peripheral.state {
    case .unknown:
        print("Unknown")

        state = "unauthorized"
    case .poweredOff:
        print("Not Started")
        state = "poweredOff"
        self.peripheralManager?.stopAdvertising()
    case .poweredOn:
        print("Available")

iOS does not have device connect and disconnect callbacks, but Android does. Therefore, the central device should subscribe to the Characteristic.  
Then didSubscribeTo means the device is connected and didUnsubscribeFrom means the device is disconnected. didUnsubscribeFrom on the Android side he is triggered twice if the device actively cancels the subscription.
